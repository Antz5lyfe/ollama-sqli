# Security Assessment Report: Jupiter Challenge 52849

## Executive Summary
This assessment aimed to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in the Jupiter Challenge login system to extract sensitive information and assess authentication security. Through rigorous testing, we confirmed a SQL Injection vulnerability on the login endpoint that allowed us to bypass authentication and successfully retrieve the protected flag.

## Methodology
- **Scanning:** Mapped the application structure and identified input vectors, discovering the login form as the primary injection point.
- **Planning:** Targeted the login endpoint based on input form discovery and analyzed server responses to injection attempts.
- **Attacking:** Crafted and tested multiple SQL Injection payloads, including error-based and UNION-based injections.
- **Evaluation:** Assessed which payloads bypassed filtering mechanisms and successfully extracted sensitive data.
- **Critique:** Confirmed filtering mechanisms triggered on naive injections; a refined UNION-based payload exploiting comment bypass succeeded.

## Key Findings
- The login form `https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/52849/login.php` accepts three parameters: `username`, `password`, and a hidden `debug` field.
- Basic injection payloads triggered filtering mechanisms, returning "SQLi detected."
- The successful vector used a UNION SELECT injection via the `username` field to extract the first flag from the database.
- No other input forms or injection points were found in the scanned scope.

## Successful Exploit Details
| Field     | Payload                                                       |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| username  | `' UNION SELECT 1,(SELECT flag FROM flags LIMIT 1),3/*`       |
| password  | `x`                                                           |
| debug     | `0`                                                           |

**Explanation:** The payload injects a UNION SELECT statement into the username parameter. This bypasses the filtering, allowing retrieval of the flag value from the database by selecting it directly from the `flags` table. The multi-line comment `/*` neutralizes trailing SQL syntax, ensuring successful execution.

## Security Implications & Recommendations
- **Impact:** The SQL Injection vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass authentication controls and access sensitive data, including flags or credentials.
- **Recommendations:**
  - Implement parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent injection.
  - Validate and sanitize all user inputs rigorously.
  - Employ Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) with updated rule sets.
  - Conduct regular security audits and code reviews.

## Lessons Learned & Next Steps
- Filters may detect and block simple injection payloads; however, advanced UNION SELECT payloads with comment techniques can circumvent basic defenses.
- Further testing with blind SQL Injection or other attack vectors could uncover additional leaks.
- Defensive measures should include context-aware sanitization and logging of suspicious input patterns.
- Continuous monitoring and patch cycles are essential to maintain security posture.
